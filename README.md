# Detection-Response

In a simulated corporate espionage scenario, I conducted a comprehensive end-to-end forensic investigation across Windows and Linux systems to identify and neutralize sophisticated threats. By leveraging PCAP analysis and protocol inspection, I reconstructed attacker timelines and mapped the breach lifecycle from the initial vector to data exfiltration. My approach integrated deep network-level forensics with granular endpoint analysis, including process enumeration and network connection auditing to detect persistence.

To overcome complex anti-forensic hurdles, I developed custom Python scripts to decrypt and recover data concealed through steganography and encryption. This focus on automation not only facilitated the recovery of critical evidence but also standardized forensic extraction processes, significantly improving the repeatability and efficiency of the investigative workflow.
